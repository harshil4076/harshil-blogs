Carstack is a marketplace for buying and selling cars. It is a full-stack application built with React, Express, and MongoDB. It is a project I built to learn more about Reactjs and to practice building a full-stack application.

The backend API is built with Express and MongoDB. The frontend is built with React.js and Material UI.
